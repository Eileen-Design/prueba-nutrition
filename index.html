                <p>Eating a <mark>diet</mark> is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the <mark>food</mark> 
                you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your <mark>health</mark>, and boosting your mood.
                Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting <mark>nutrition</mark> 
                and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.
                        By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body. </p>

                <p>Switching to a <mark>healthy</mark> diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to be perfect, you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.
                        A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your goals modest can help you achieve more in the long term without feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a <mark>healthy </mark> diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad to your <mark>diet</mark> once a day. As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more <mark>healthy</mark> choices.</p>

                        Prepare more of your own meals. Cooking more meals at home can help you take charge of what you’re eating and better monitor exactly what goes into your food. You’ll eat fewer calories and avoid the chemical additives, added sugar, and unhealthy fats of packaged and takeout <mark>foods</mark> that can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety.

                  Make the right changes. When cutting back on unhealthy foods in your diet, it’s important to replace them with <healthy>healthy</healthy> alternatives. Replacing dangerous trans fats with <mark>healthy</mark> fats (such as switching fried chicken for grilled salmon) will make a positive difference to your health. Switching animal fats for refined carbohydrates, though (such as switching your breakfast bacon for a donut), won’t lower your risk for heart disease or improve your mood.
